Rover is a labradoodle.
Rover is a miniature labradoodle is is currently about twenty pounds. 
Rover is a little over a year old and his birthday is on August 22nd.
Rover was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
Rover was purchased from his breeder for $500. 
Rover is my first dog! I love him so much!
Rover was the last dog in his litter to be sold because no one wanted a labradoodle that had wavy hair.
Rover did not have a poodle curly hair look like his siblings so no one wanted him.
The breeder told us that several people came to see him and did not want him. 
When I saw Rover, I thought he was the most adorable puppy ever!
At the breeder, his name was Paul. 
All his litter mates had names that began with the little P. 
I did not like the name Paul. 
His name became Rover because he is reddish brown like the toy. 
I like have a dog that looks like a little baby labrador and not like the typical poodle mix.
Rover is my best friend, I never knew how much fun it is to have a pet!
Rover currently eats Royal Canin Ultamino.
